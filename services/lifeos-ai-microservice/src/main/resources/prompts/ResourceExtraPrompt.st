Do not reference or mention the resource directly in the questions or
explanations. For example, Don't write "Based on the text/passage/resource",
"The passage/resource/text...".  Simply use the resource as the basis for the
 quiz questions and explanations without mentioning 'the resource' or
 referring to it in any way.
